This is a tool to create ME*N (Mongo, Express, Vue/AngularJS/React, Node) apps. It's a work in progress.

It currently creates everything but the front end.

## Usage:
For now, you can't. Once it's in a usable condition, and published:

1. `npm install -g healy-app`
2. (In folder you wanna create your new app in) `healy-app`
3. Follow instructions.
4. App!
